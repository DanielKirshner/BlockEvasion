## Description
**Block Evasion is an android game-app developed in Android Studio.**
* The main goal is to avoid the blocks by moving your character, as long as you survive - the blocks becoming faster!
* There is also a "Game Stats" screen which displays your high score and how many games you have played
* I made all of the graphics and the sprites with the great GIMP software
* I made all of the game soundtrack by myself with FL-Studio

4. In the new android versions there is a block message from "Play Protect" services, that's because my game don't have google play certificate - Choose "INSTALL ANYWAY"
